Problem statement: Try to implement data migration using sll in the most basic manner(from perspective of a 3rd sem BE student with minimum coding knowledge)

Description:
The code is menu-driven and written in C. Here I create 2 SLL's, one represents system in which data is migrated and the other contains data to be migrated (say,from some database) .I create 2 structures , each representing a SLL.I use a function 'insert', to insert data in database (due to my limited knowledge, instead of actually transporting data, I created this function) .The 'copy' function is used to copy data from database to system and 'delete1' to delete data from database (this is to imitate migration of data) .The'delete' function is used to delete data from the system (as and when required by the user) .The 'display' function is used to display the migrated data.
The 'main' function uses 'for'loop (infinite loop) and 'switch' to create a menu driven program.
